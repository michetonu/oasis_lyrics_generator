meant for someone else but not for me
love was out to get me

 clever and free
loaded just like a gun you're the hero that's still unsung living on borrowed time you're my sun
 and you're gonna shine talking to myself again this time i think i'm getting through it's funny how you think it's funny how
 it's funny how when you do
born on a different cloud from the ones that have burst round town it's no surprise to me that you're classless
 clever and free
lonely soul busy working overtime nothing ever gets done especially when your hands are tied lonely soul
baking up your mother's pride nothing ever gets done not until your war's won
born on a different cloud you're born on a different cloud born on a different cloud born on a different cloud born on a different cloud born on a different cloud born on a different cloud born on a different cloud

what was that sound ringing around your brain?
 today was just a blur  you gotta head like a ghost train what was that sound ringing around your brain?
 you're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?
 you're the outcast   you're the underclass but you don't care   because you're living fast you're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end i know you've got a problem that the devil sends you think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who i'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight
 bring it on down
 bring it down for me your head's in a fish tank your body and your mind can't breath you're the outcast - you're the underclass but you don't care - because you're living fast you're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end i know you've got a problem that the devil sends you think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who i'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight
(instrumental)can you see it now?
i can see it now
can you see it now?
i can see it now
can you see it now?
'cause i can see it now
can you see it now?

can you see it now?
well i can see it now

'cause i can see it now
if you gave me a fresh carnation
i would only crush it's tender petals
with me you'll have no escape
and at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle
i trample down all life in my wake
i eat it up and take the cake
i just avert my eyes to the pain
of someone's loss helping my gain
if you gave me a dream for my pocket
you'd be plugging in the wrong socket
with me there's no room for the future
with me there's no room with a view at all
i am out of season all year around
hear machinery roar to my empty sound
touch my heart and feel winter
hold my hand and be doomed forever
if you gave me a fresh carnation
i would only crush it's tender petals
with me you'll have no escape
and at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle
and if you're wondering by now who i am
look no further than the mirror
cause i am the greed and fear
and every ounce of hate in you
i heard a whisper on my radio
but i paid no mind
i just sat back and let it go
to catch the rain from a lonely waterfall
but i might beware'cause they could drown me like a doll
they got me running in and out of time
i feel like a bona fide
keeper of the right and wrong
and i've known all along but let me just make it clear
everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution
but faith in any god is gonna bury us all
no-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
have faith in what you got and it will carry us all
carry us all
i slip my skin as the prophets reappear
but i paid no mind
i'm just trying to persevere
with the sins i have to shake from me within
though i might beware'cause they're just trying to wear me thin
they got me running in and out of time
i feel like a bona fide
keeper of the right and wrong
and i've known all along but let me just make it clear
everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution
but faith in any god is gonna bury us all
no-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
have faith in what you got and it will carry us all
carry us all
everybody's gone for a quick sure fire solution
but faith in any god is gonna bury us all
no-one's gonna fight in a ten-bob revolution
have faith in what you got and it will carry us all
carry us all

cause it ain't all that as far as i can tell
i don't mind not going to heaven
as long as they've got cigarettes
as long as they've got cigarettes in hell
and by the time we start getting used to it
the dope that's forming on the windowsill
now we know we've got ourselves into
the cage that keeps the mice on the treadmill
i don't mind not being immortal
cause it ain't all that as far as i can tell
i don't mind not going to heaven
as long as they've got cigarettes
as long as they've got cigarettes in hell

at the rottin' oasis
stealing kisses
from the leperous faces
heads are hanging
from the garbageman trees
mouthwash
 jukebox
 gasoline
pistols are pointing
at a poor man's pockets
smiling eyes
whippin' out of the sockets
got a devils haircut in my mind (x4)love machines
on the sympathy crutches
discount orgies
on the dropout buses
hitchin' a ride
with the bleedin' noses
comin' to town
with the briefcase blues

cause my mind is fading
ghetto blastin' disintegrating
rock 'n' roll
know what i'm saying?
everywhere i look
there's a devil in waiting

 coming down and i want to be there when you hit the ground so don't go away  say what you say but say that you'll stay forever and a day
in the time of my life 'cause i need more time  yes i need more time just to make things right damn my situation and the games i have to play with all the things caught in my mind damn my education i can't find the words to say about all the things caught in my mind me and you what's going on?
 all we seem to know is how to show the feelings that are wrong
slip inside the eye of your mind
don't you know you might find
a better place to play
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
will slowly fade away
so i start a revolution from my bed'cos you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside
 summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
and so sally can wait
 she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
 but don't look back in anger i heard you say
take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
but please don't put your life in the hands
of a rock n roll band
who'll throw it all away
i'm gonna start a revolution from my bed'cos you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside 'cos summertime's in bloom
stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face'cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
so sally can wait
 she knows it's too late as she's walking on by
my soul slides away
 but don't look back in anger i heard you say
so sally can wait
 she knows it's too late as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
 but don't look back in anger i heard you say
so sally can wait
she knows it's too late as she's walking on by
my soul slides away
but don't look back in anger

i heard you say
at least not today
i haven't seen your face round
since i was kid
your bringing back those memories
of the thing that we did
you're hanging round and climbing trees
pretending to fly
d'yer want to be a spaceman and live in the sky
you got how many bills to pay
and how many kids
and you forgot about the things that we did
the town where we're living has made you a man
and all of your dreams are washed in the sand
well it's alright

who are you and me to say
what's wrong and what's right
do you still feel like me
we sit down here
and we shall see
we can talk
and find common ground
and we can just forget
about feeling down
we can just forget
about life in this town
 it's funny how your dreams
change as you're growing old
you don't want to be no spaceman
you just want gold
allthe dream stealers
are lying in wait
but if you want to be a spaceman
it's still not too late well it's alright

who are you and me to say
what's wrong and what's right
do you still feel like me

my eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
and if there's a god would he give another chancer
an hour to sing for his soul 'cause my family don't seem so familiar
and my enemies all know my name
and when you hear me tap on yer window
yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way 'cause my family don't seem so familiar

sits by the phone on her own
but the phone don't ring
and the birds don't sing in her tree
she lost herself in a haze of pity
and doesn't know where to run
she's a headshrinker now
and i think it's time we have some fun
lost in a fog
i've been treated like a dog
and i'm out of here
i got no name
and i feel no shame
and i got no fear
and i bow down
to the tears of a clown
whatever's going down
is coming around
i hope you don't regret today
for the rest of your lives
lost in a fog
i've been treated like a dog
and i'm out of here

though nothing-nothing will keep us together
we can beat them-for ever and ever
oh we can be heroes-just for one day
i-i will be king
and you-you will be queen
though nothing will drive them away
we can beat them-just for one day
we can be heroes-just for one day
and you-you can be mean
and i-i'll drink all the time'cause we're lovers-and that is a fact
yes we're lovers-and that is that
though nothing-will keep us together
we could steal time-just for one day
we can be heroes-for ever and ever
what do you say?
i-i can remember
standing-by the wall
and the guns-shot above our heads
and we kissed-as though nothing could fall
and the shame-was on the other side
oh we can beat them-forever and ever
then we could be heroes-just for one day
we can be heroes
just for one day
we can be heroes
we're nothing
 and nothing will help us
maybe we're lying
 then you better not stay
but we could be safer
 just for one day

hey hey
 my my
rock and roll will never die
here's more to the picture than meets the eye
hey hey
 my my
you're out of the blue and into the black
they give you this but you pay for for that
and when you die
 no you don't come back
cos your out of the blue and into the black
my my
 hey hey
rock and roll is here to stay
it's better to burn out than to fade away
my my
 hey hey
i hitched a ride with my soul
by the side of the road
just as the sky turned black
i took a walk with my fame
down memory lane
i never did find my way back
you know that i gotta say time's slipping away
and what will it hold for me
what am i gonna do while i'm looking at you
you're standing ignoring me
i thought that i heard someone say now there's no time for running away now
hey now!
 hey now!
feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain
feel no shame
the first thing i saw
as i walked through the door
was a sign on the wall that read
it said you might never know
that i want you to know
what is written inside of your head
and time as it stands won't be held in my hands
or living inside of my skin and as it fell from the sky i asked myself why can i never let anyone in?
i thought that i heard someone say now there's no time for running away now
hey now!
 hey now!
feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain
feel no shame
i hitched a ride with my soul
by the side of the road
just as the sky turned black
i took a walk with my fame
down memory lane
i never did find my way back
you know that i gotta say time's slipping away
and what will it hold for me
what am i gonna do while i'm looking at you
you're standing ignoring me
i thought that i heard someone say now
there's no time for running away now
hey now!
 hey now!
feel no shame - 'cause time's no chain
feel no shame
i can go where i want to be who i want to be now i can sleep under water never worried what i'm gonna dream now yeah
 the time's come and gone and i know where i'm from and can be so
it's hasta mañana you're on your own banana skin feet now yeah
 i've been hung in a bad place had no sun over my face i've been hung in a bad place for too long  i can say what i want to feel how i want to feel now i can squeeze all the hours i choose to devour with ease now i can sing to the trees tarzan on harmonies for free
 yeah you've been blocked
 and you're stalling nature is calling for me you got me!
yeah
 i've been hung in a bad place had no sun over my face i've been hung in a bad place for too long
 for too long
for too long
 for too long
i can take 'em all
so i leave you with this thought
there is a fire in the sky
i don't need no alibi
see i believe in all
do you hear me when i say
that i got to walk this way
there is a fire in the sky
i don't need no alibi
see i believe in all
and i-i-i will catch you when you fall
that is what i'm gonna do
and i-i-i-i will catch you if you call
that is what i'm gonna do
i can see for miles
and i can see you when your cries
there is a fire in the sky
i don't need no alibi
see i believe in all
do you hear me when i say
that i gotta walk this way
there is a fire in the sky
i don't need no alibi
see i believe in all
and i-i-i will catch you when you fall
that is what i'm gonna do
and i-i-i-i will catch you if you call
that is what i'm gonna do
baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
and now that i feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed
the name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
he thought he was king creole
until he found out
 until he found out he sits upon a throne
he lives a sleazy lie
but he's all alone again
 again i can see a liar
 sitting by the fire
trouble in his heart
 laughing at the thought
coming as he goes into overdose
i wonder what he thinks of me?
they're trying hard to put me in my place
and that is why i gotta keep running
the future's mine and its no disgrace'cause in the end the past means nothing
you tell me i'm free then you tie me down
and from my chains i think it's a pity
what did it cost you to wear my crown
you don't like it so why don't you admit it
d'you feel a little down today?
bet you ain't got much to say?
you're gonna miss me when i'm not there
and you know i don't care
 you know i don't care
as we beg and steal and borrow
life is hit and miss and this
i hope
 i think
 i know
and if i ever hear the names you call
if i stumble catch me when i fall'cause baby after all
 you'll never forget my name
help me
 defy the light the shining on me
to get back what they've taken from me
with a little fire where it's cold
show me
 the path that leads to all the glory
the words that tell a sacred story
with a little fire where it's cold
i wanna live in a dream in my record machine
i wanna picture the world and everyone inside my mouth
cos all the money i waste
 is it a matter of taste?
i wanna picture the world and you can't make me spit it out
take me
 back from the darkness where they
sent me
 give hope to places to where they can't be
with a little fire where it's cold
i wanna live in a dream in my record machine
i wanna picture the world n everyone inside my mouth
cos all the money i waste
 is it a matter of taste?
i wanna picture the world and you can't make me spit it out
you can't give me a reason i want me want to shine
you can't give me the feelings cos they're already mine
you get one in a million and if the sun won't rise
on my soul
 then i'll go
i'm locked up in chainsfor the rest of my lifethere's no one else to blame but methe start of the day'sjust the end of the nighti'm feeling like i'm lost at seasometimes is just seems so simplei'm feeling like i'm down on my kneessometimes like a man in the middlei don't know my own mindwon't you let me be

my heart it skips a beat when i behold
the light that's shining through your eyes of gold
from heavenly blood you seem to spring
from heavenly waters you can drink
i'll meet you on a day that never ends
i'll greet you in a way that heaven meant
you lay me down gently on the leaves
you cover me over in my sleep
i never did say that i wish i could
i never could pray 'cause it's just no good
i hope you don't break my heart of stone
i don't want to scream out loud
and wake up on my own
and as i close my eyes
and the sky turns red
i realize just what you are
you're an idler's dream
and you're singing shangri-la
shangri-la
when i wake up early in the morning
lift my head
 i'm still yawning
when i'm in the middle of a dream
stay in bed
 float up stream (float up stream)please
 don't wake me
 no
 don't shake me
leave me where i am - i'm only sleeping
everybody seems to think i'm lazy
i don't mind
 i think they're crazy
running everywhere at such a speed
till they find there's no need (there's no need)please
 don't spoil my day
 i'm miles away
and after all i'm only sleeping
keeping an eye on the world going by my window
taking my time
lying there and staring at the ceiling
waiting for a sleepy feeling
please
 don't wake me
 no
 don't shake me
leave me where i am - i'm only sleeping
keeping an eye on the world going by my window
taking my time
when i wake up early in the morning
lift my head
 i'm still yawning
when i'm in the middle of a dream
stay in bed
 float up stream (float up stream)please
 don't wake me
 no
 don't shake me
leave me where i am - i'm only sleeping
here is a song
it reminds me of when we were young
looking back at all the things we've done
you gotta keep on
 keepin' on
out to sea
 it's the only place i honestly
can't get myself some piece of mind
you know it's getting hard to fly
if i'm to fall
would you be there to applaud?
or would you hide behind them all?
cause if i have to go
in my heart you grow
and that's where you belong
if i'm to fall
would you be there to applaud?
or would you hide behind them all?
cause if i have to go
in my heart you'll grow
and that's where you belong
if i'm to fall
would you be there to applaud?
or would you hide behind them all?
cause if i have to go
in my heart you'll grow
and that's where you belong
guess i'm outta time
i'm outta time
it must have been love
lay a whisper on my pillow
leave the winter on the ground
i wake up lonely
there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around
touch me now
i close my eyes and dream away
it must have been love but it's over now
it must have been good but i lost it somehow
it must have been love but it's over now
from the moment we touched 'til the time had run out
make-believing we're together
that i'm sheltered by your heart
but in and outside
i've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm
and it's a hard winter's day
i dream away
it must have been love but it's over now
it was all that i wanted
now i'm living without
it must have been love but it's over now
it's where the water flows
it's where the wind blows
well you can say what you want
but you won't get a thing from me
and if you don't understand
that's it's not in your hands you need
let there be love
but you can say what you feel
and it might never steal from me
and then you must understand
that it's all in your hands what you need
let there be love
and i never knew
but all the thing's that you've done
are coming right back to you
but everybody know's that it's no crime
but does it make you feel ashamed
you never said what you done
and there's no need to blame
but everybody knows
 yeah everybody knows
everybody knows that it's no crime
 it's no crime
so you can say what you want
but you'll not get a thought from me
but if you say what you mean
then you might get a thing from me
let there be love
if i ever knew
that all the thing's i've thought
are coming right back to you
but everybody thinks that it's a crime
it never makes you feel ashamed
you sit around and you sold
and you're passing the blame
but everybody knows
yeah everybody knows
everybody knows that it's a crime
it's a crime (3x)
it's better people
 love one another'cause livin' your life can be tough
it's better people
 speak to each other
your shame is not enough
if everybody came alive
and stayed alive
and lived their lives instead
 yeah
so come outside
and feel the light
it's cold inside
but it's lonely in your bed
 in your bed
and you though we might be
but what you heard before
was only sleepin' in your brain
but if you came with me
the days'd never end
would never be the same
they'd never be the same
never be the same
it's better people
 love one another'cause livin' your life can be tough
it's better people
 speak to each other
your shame is not enough
if everybody came alive
and stayed alive
and lived their lives instead
 yeah

and feel the light
it's cold inside
and it's lonely in your bed
 in your bed
and you though we might be
but what you heard before
is sleepin' in your brain
but if you came with me
the days'd never end
would never be the same
they'd never be the same
this is goin by a different name
they'd never be the same
say something shout it from the rooftops off your head
make it sort of mean something make me understand
or i'll forget
the people here on lifes beaches
they wish upon the waves that hide the sand
let them know that life theaches you
to build a castle in your hand
maybe the songs that we sing are wrong
maybe the dreams that we dream are gone
bring it on home and it won't be long
it's getting better man!
hey!
 what was that you said to me?
just say the word and i'd be free?
and when the stars are shining bright
we're getting better man!
and crashing in upon a wave
it's calling out beyond the grave
and we're the fire in the sky
we're getting better man!
build something
 build a better place and call it home

cos maybe the songs that we sing are wrong
maybe the dreams that we dream are gone

you point the finger at me but i don't believe
paint me a wish on a velvet sky
you demand the answers but don't know why
in my mind there is no time
yeah little things they make me so happy
all i want to do is live by the sea
yeah little things they make me so happy
but it's good yes it's good it's good to be free
so what would you say if i said to you
it's not in what you say it's in what you do
you point the finger at me but i don't believe
bring it on home to where we found
head is like a rock sitting upside down
in my mind there is no time
yeah little things they make me so happy

i'm getting tired
i'm sick of all my records
and the clothes i bought today
am i cracking up
or just getting older?
i'm staying in
i can't be bothered
making conversation with the friends
that i don't know
am i cracking up or just getting older?
and i bet that this is how life
turns out when you're finally grown
and you know if this is my life
i'll sit around all day and i'll moan
i'm half way up to the bottom
of another bottle of my next best favourite friend
i'm not cracking up
i'm just getting older
no i'm not cracking up
i'm just getting older
no i'm not cracking up
i'm just getting older
four seasons
 seconds
 flicker
 and flash
 i'm alone
a lonely scream provides the scene - it's no hope
every night i hear you scream
 but you don't say what you mean
this was my dream
 but now my dream has flown
i'm at the crossroads
 waiting for a sign
my life is standing still
 but i'm still alive
every night i think i know
in the morning where did it go?
the answers disappear when i open my eyes
i'm a stranger to this place
 where real life and dreams collide
and even though i fall from grace
 i will keep the dream alive
i will keep the dream alive
four seasons
 seconds
 flicker
 and flash
 i'm alone

hey hey hey
i know you think you deserve an explanation on the meanings of life
but what you think that you heard slipped away out the back of your mind
you'll get your mucky fingers burned
you get your truth from the lies you were learned
and all your plastic believers will leave us and they won't return
and when you look in that mirror and you're tying up your buttons and bows
and as you face your disease you can squeeze into the emporer's clothes
you found your god in a paper bag
 you get your history from the union jack
and all your brothers and sisters are gone and they won't come back
i'm fed up with life in the city
all the phoneys have blown my mind
when i'm gone
 you look like you'd miss me
so come along with me - but don't ask why
'cause it's all mine
it's all mine
'cause it's all mine
it's all mine
sometimes i listen to what people try to say
and then when i tune in i think no that's not the way
sometimes i listen to what people have to say
and then when i tune in i think no that's not the way
it must be the music
it sounds so confusing
it must be the music that's opening my eyes
it must be the music
it sounds so confusing
it must be the music making me satisfied
sometimes i listen to what people try to say
and then when i tune in i think no that's not the way
sometimes i listen to what people have to say
and then when i tune in i think no that's not the way it must be the music
it sounds so confusing
it must be the music that's opening my eyes
it must be the music
it sounds so confusing
it must be the music making me satisfied
everybody knows
but no one's saying nothing  and it's a sound so very loud
that no one can hear?
 i got something in my shoes
it's keeping me from walking down the long and winding road
back home to you and round this town you've ceased to be that's what you got for sleeping with the enemy where angels fly you won't play so guess who's gonna take the blame for
 my big mouth  my big name who'll put on my shoes while they're walking slowly down the hall of fame?
 into my big mouth
 you can fly a plane who'll put on my shoes while they're walking slowly down the hall of fame?
 slowly down the hall of fame?
 i ain't never spoke to god and i ain't never been to heaven but you assumed i knew the way even though the map was given and as you look into the eyes of a bloody cold assassin only then you realise with who's life you have been messin'
people try to put us down(talkin' 'bout my generation) just because we get around(talkin' 'bout my generation) things they do look awful cold(talkin' 'bout my generation) i hope i die before get old(talkin' 'bout my generation) this is my generation this is my generation

 baby my my my my generation

the day's moving just too fast for me
i need some time in the sunshine
i gotta slow it right down
the day's moving just too fast for me
i live my life for the stars that shine
people say it's just a waste of time
then they say i should feed my head
that to me was just a day in bed
i'll take my car and drive real far
they're not concerned about the way we are
in my mind my dreams are real
now we're concerned about the way i feel
tonight i'm a rock 'n' roll star

i'm older than i wish to be
this town holds no more for me
all my life i try to find another way
i don't care for your attitude
you bring me down i think you're rude
all my life i try to make a better day
it's hard enough being alone
sitting here by the phone
waiting for my memories
to come and play
it's hard enough sitting there
rockin' in your rockin' chair
it's all too much for me to take
when you're not there
it's hard enough being alone
sitting here by the phone
waiting for my memories
to come and play
it's hard enough sitting there
rockin' in your rockin' chair
it's all too much for me to take

it's hard enough sitting there
rockin' in your rockin' chair
it's all too much for me to take
when you're not there
i can give a hundred million reasons
to build a barricade
i blame it on the changing of the seasons
the thoughts that i've conveyed does it make it all right?
it doesn't make it all right to roll it over my soul and leave me here
roll it over my soul and leave me here look around at all the plastic people
who live without a care
try to sit with me around my table
but never bring a chair and in your head do you feel
what you're not supposed to feel
you take what you want
but you won't get it for free
you need more time'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more
but i'm not sure if it ever works out right
but it's ok
 it's all right and in your head do you feel
what you're not supposed to feel
when you take what you want
you don't get hope for free
you need more time'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more
and i'm not sure if it'll ever
 ever
 ever work out right
will it ever
 ever
 ever work out right?
'cause it never
 never
 never works out right
you gotta roll with it you gotta take your time you gotta say what you say don't let anybody get in your way 'cause it's all too much for me to take don't ever stand aside don't ever be denied you ought to be who you be if you're coming with me i think i've got a feeling i've lost inside i think i'm gonna take me away and hide i'm thinking things that i just can't abide i know the roads on which your life will drive i find the key that lets you slip inside kiss the girl she's not behind the door do you know i think i recognize your face but i've never seen you before  i know the roads on which your life will drive i find the key that lets you slip inside kiss the girl she's not behind the door do you know i think i recognize your face but i've never seen you before don't ever stand aside don't ever be denied you ought to be who you be if you're coming with me i think i've got a feeling i've lost inside 
the paper boy is working before he goes
lying to the teacher he knows he knows
he didn't and he should've
brought his lines in yesterday
ernie bangs the sound and the day begins
the letterbox is open and your cash falls in
i'll meet you at the office
just before the staff clock in round are way the birds are singing
round are way the sun shines bright
round are way the birds sing for yer
the already know yer the game is kicking off in around the park
it's twenty five a side and before it's dark
there's gonna be a loser
and you know the next goal wins
cab it to the front as it's called a draw
everybody's knockin at yours once more
ernie bangs the sound
and no one's spoken since half past four round are way the birds are singing
round are way the sun shines bright
round are way the birds are minging
round are way it's alright
round are way the birds sing for you'cause the already know yer
they already know yer
sing a sad song
in a lonely place
try to put a word in from me
it's been so long since i found this place
you better put in two or three
we as people are just walking 'round
our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
what we don't see
well it can't be real
what we don't touch we cannot feel
where we're living in this town
the sun is coming up and it's going down
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
and we cheat and we lie
nobody says it's wrong
so we don't ask why'cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
we're throwing it all away
we're throwing it all away at the end of the day
if you're needing
something i can give
i know i'd help you if i can
if your honest and you say that you did
you know that i would give you my hand
or a sad song
in a lonely place
i'll try to put a word in for you
need a shoulder?
  well if that's the case
you know there's nothing i wouldn't do
where we're living in this town
the sun is coming up and it's going down
but it's all just the same at the end of the day
when we cheat and we lie
nobody says it's wrong
so we don't ask why'cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
don't throw it all away
throwing it all away
you're throwing it all away at the end of the day
when you kiss the base o'my spine
make my body into your shrine
you give me this feeling deep inside
one that i can no longer disguise
while other snakes just she'd their skins
forked tongues pointing out my sins
even though i realise that history's not on my side
even though i realise the pioneer skin still curls up in my eyes
if i don't go crazy
 i'll lose my mind
i saw a life before me but now i'm blind
i wanna go to heaven
 never been there before
i wanna go to heaven
 so you kill me some more
flying high upon the gallows
too messed up to step out of the shadows
a drugged up heart that knows no sorrow
rescued from this deep dark hollow
stick on these boots and sharpen the nails
time is nigh for you leather girls
maybe we should end this race
vanish while we cannot leave no trace
if i don't go crazy
 i'll lose my mind
i saw a life before me
 but now i'm blind
see one-arm film stars on alien beaches
potted gold and tattooed faces
harrison murals on the corner
 tupperware boxes full of hops
diazepam dreams there catching streams
paper dinosaurs flash blue and green
still i've got a flash-bulb head
if i don't go crazy
 i'll lose my mind
i saw a life before me but now i'm blind
i wanna go to heaven
 never been there before
i wanna go to heaven
 so you kill me some more
come along nice

scorpio rising

they took my faith
they put it in a headlock and
they sealed my fate
somewhere inside the world
in which they live
because i failed
they constantly ignore me and
they told me i lost my mind but
i believe that i rule the world
i'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
and you can pitch your gold against my soul
but i bet you get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
it won't be long
till i solve my mystery
it would for me
what do i believe in and
a masterkey
is somewhere inside of the world in which i live
and what for they
they will speak for no-one
and i may have lost my mind
but i believe that i rule my world
i'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
you can pitch your gold against my soul
but i bet you get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
it won't be long
till i solve my mystery
and i'm singing out my revolution song
like nothing else matters
and you can pitch your gold against my soul
but you gotta get shattered
and there's a million houses in my heart
and it won't be long
it won't be long
till i solve my mystery
some might say that sunshine follows thunder
go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
some might say that we should never ponder
on our thoughts today cos they hold sway over time
some might say we will find a brighter day
cos i've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
you made no preparation for my reputation once again
the sink is full of fishes
she's got dirty dishes on the brain
it was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend
some might say they don't believe in heaven
go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
some might say you get what you've been given
if you don't get yours i won't get mine as well
some might say we will find a brighter day
cos i've been standing at the station
in need of education in the rain
you made no preparation for my reputation once again
the sink is full of fishes
cos she's got dirty dishes on the brain
and my dog's been itchin'itchin' in the kitchen once again
some might say some might say
you know what some might say

chewin' on a bone
a thousand million miles from home

who will rise?
it would be so nice to hear you say
thank you for the good times before the good times fly away
your eyes are telling lies
some of the stories on the way
but it's so nice but don't let the good times fly away
i drink to every sucker standing here
among the few who try and cheat the years there's always one of us who's blown away
or strapped and stopped for breath along the way
who will rise?

breaks like glass
but not in your hand
they'll shoot you down
right where you stand
and it don't care for what you wear
or which way you might sway
it calls you up
but not on the phone
and it will drag you from your throne and you may laugh while you sit there
sipping your champagne
and may i laugh at your despair
sniffing your cocaine
i'm a man of choice in an old rolls royce
and i'm howling at the moon
is my happening to deafening
for you?
 it's maybe the fame
it's for calling your name
it's sees you crying
never did explain
am i the name
blowing through you
like a hurricane it's a shame
it's a shame
it's a shame it will not fall
not from the sky
and it don't eat no humble pie
and you may have your quiet life
but i bet you don't know why
it makes you a mess
you didn't believe
you still don't know what makes me breathe and you may laugh while you sit there
sipping your champagne
and may i laugh at your despair
while you're sniffing your cocaine
i'm a man of choice in an old rolls royce
and i'm howling at the moon
is this happening to deafening
for you?

 as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
i'll be fine - if you give me a minute
 a man's got a limit

take the time to make some sense
of what you want to say
and cast your words away upon the waves
bring them back with acquiesce
on a ship of hope today
and as they fall upon the shore
tell them not to fear no more
say it loud and sing it proud
and they
 will dance if they want to dance
please brother take a chance
you know they're gonna go
which way they want to go
all we know is that we don't know
what is gonna be
please brother let it be
life on the other hand won't let you understand
why we're all part of the masterplan i'm not saying right is wrong
it's up to us to make
the best of all things that come our way
and all the things that came have past
the answer's in the looking glass
there's four and twenty million doors
down life's endless corridor
say it loud and sing it proud
and they
 will dance if they want to dance
please brother take a chance
you know they're gonna go
which way they want to go
all we know is that we don't know
what is gonna be
please brother let it be
life on the other hand won't let you understand
why we're all part of the masterplan

brought on by the cold

mining our dreams for the same old song
why hope for the turning
if everything you know is wrongso come on
 shake your rag doll
 baby
before you change your mind
then come on
 when the rapture takes me
be the fallen angel by my side
you carry the lantern
i'll carry you home
you search for the disappeared
i'll bury the cold
yours is a messiah
mine is a dream and it won't be long
no hope for the journey
if no-one ever sees the dawn
so come on
 shake your rag doll
 baby
before you change your mind
then come on
 when the rapture takes me
will you be by my sideso come on
 shake your rag doll

to be someone must be a wonderful thing
a famous footballer a rock singer
or a big film star
 yes i think that i would like
i would like that
to be rich and have a lot of fans
and lots of girls to prove that i'm a man
to be number one - and loved by everyone
getting drugged up with my trendy friends
they really dig me
 man
 and i dig them
and the money that i spend
 it is like my fame
 and it's quickly gone
no more swimming in my guitar shaped pool
no more reporters at my beck and call
no more cocaine
 now it's only ground chalk
and i can't afford a taxi so i have to walk
didn't i have a nice time
wasn't it sucha nice time
didn't i have a nice time
i realize i should have stuck to my guns
you stood me out just like a bastard son
and i lost myself
 but i know that it was wrong
and it cost me a lot
no more drinking cause now the club shuts down
and i'm out here on my arse with the rest of you clowns
i get really scared without my bodyguard
and i'm sitting all alone in my expensive yard
didn't i have a nice time
wasn't it such a nice time
didn't i have a nice time
wasn't it such a nice time
i remember it was a nice time
to be someone must be a wonderful thing
day's turning to night
pray for the light
let me come through
let me take you away over the line
everyone falling
dreamers come crawling
neighbors jump walling
let me come through
let me take you away over the line
and we're away to be where there's life
shake the will to comply
fears don't try me
tears don't cry me
and we're away to be where there's life
when we come call out
everything's sold out
tv just closed down
there's nothing on the news now
fears don't try me
tears don't cry me
we're away to be where there's life
be where there's life(be where there's life)dig out your soul
 cos here we go
we gotta move
 it's what we do
let me come through
let me take you away to be where there's life
to be where there's life(to be where there's life)take you over the light
under the signs
in through locked doors to secret floors
where we've lost 'em before
turn off your mind
 relax
and float down stream
it is not dying
lay down all thought
surrender to the void
it is shining
that you may see
the meaning of within
it is being
that love is all
and love is everyone
it is knowing
that ignorance and hate
may mourn the dead
it is believing
but listen to the
color of your dreams
it is not living
or play the game
existence to the end
of the beginning
trouble
oh trouble set me free
i have seen your face
and it's too much too much for me
trouble
oh trouble can't you see
you're eating my heart away
and there's nothing much left of me
i've drunk your wine
you have made your world mine
so won't you be fair
i don't want no more of you
so won't you be kind to me
just let me go where
i'll have to go there
trouble
oh trouble move away
i have seen your face
and it's too much for me today
trouble
oh trouble can't you see
you have made me a wreck
now won't you leave me in my misery
i've seen your eyes
and i can see death's disguise
hangin' on me
i'm beat
 i'm torn
shattered and tossed and worn
too shocking to see
trouble
oh trouble move from me
i have paid my debt
now won't you leave me in my misery
trouble
oh trouble please be kind
i don't want no fight
and i haven't got a lot of time
i carry a madness
everywhere i go
over the border
and back to the snow
so if you see me
and i look right through
you should not take it
as a reflection on you
come on
 turn up the sun
turn it up for everyone
love one another
the boys in the bubble
want to be free
they got so blind
that they cannot see
well i'm not your keeper
i don't have your key
i got a piano
but i can't find the see
come one
 turn up the sun
turn it up for everyone
love one another
come on
 turn up the sun
turn it up
 for everyone
love one another
underneath the sky of red
is a storyteller sleeping alone
he has no face and he has no name
and his whereabouts are sort of unknown
all he needs is his life in a suitcase
it belongs to a friend of a friend's
and as we drink to ourselves
we'll amuse ourselves
underneath the sky
underneath the sky again
so wish me away to an unknown place
am i living in a land with no name
i'll be making a start with my brand new heart
stop me making sense once again
all we need is our lives in a suitcase
they belong to a friend of a friend's
and as we drink to ourselves
we'll amuse ourselves
underneath the sky
underneath the sky again
all we need is our lives in a suitcase
they belong to a friend of a friend's
and as we drink to ourselves
we'll amuse ourselves
underneath the sky
underneath the sky again
again again again again
underneath the sky again
i don't know what it is that makes me feel alive
i don't know how to wake the things that sleep inside
i only wanna see the light that shines behind your eyes
i hope that i can say the things i wish i'd said
to sing my soul to sleep and take me back to bed
you want to be alone when we can be alive instead
because we need each other
we believe in one another
and i know we're gonna uncover what's sleepin' in our soul
because we need each other
we believe in one another
and i know we're gonna uncover what's sleepin' in our soul
what's sleepin' in our soul
there are many things that i would like to know
and there are many places that i wish to go
but everything's depending on the way the wind may blow
repeat verse 1repeat 
cause' we belive x4
 because we need x2

you know that feeling you get
you feel you´re older than time
you ain´t exactly sure
if you´ve been away a while
do you keep the receipts
for the friends that you buy
and ain´t it bittersweet
you were only just getting by
but i hope you know
that it won´t let go
it sticks around with you until the day you die
and i hope you know that it´s touch and go
i hope the tears don´t stain the world that waits outside
where did it all go wrong?
and until you´ve heard
the dreams you bought for your lies
you´ll be castaway
alone under the stormy skies
but i hope you know
that it won´t let go
it sticks around with you until the day you die
and i hope you know that it´s touch and go
i hope the tears don´t stain the world that waits outside
where did it all go wrong?
found what i'd lost inside
my spirit has been purified
take a thorn from my pride
and hand in hand we'll take a walk outside thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
who feels love
now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
i feel love i'm leaving all that i see
now all my emotions fill the air i breath now you understand that this is not the promised land
they spoke of
there's nothing more to be
if you can be the remedy who heals love
who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?
who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?
lost behind a silver screen
are all the things you could've been to us
so don't try to fuck up my head with your problems
i'm just tryin' to fix up my bed in the doldrums
lost behind a silver screen
are all the things you could've been in love and life soooooohelp me out my friend
my head just started to hurt
i don't pretend
i've got all of the time in the world
so now she's gone
all alone in her own universe
i still walk on'til i hold you within my world

my head just started to hurt
i won't pretend
i've got all of the time in the world
so now she's gone
all alone in her own universe

who put the weight of the world on my shoulders?
who put the lies in the truth that you sold us?
today is gonna be the day
that they're gonna throw it back to you
by now you should've somehow
realized what you gotta do
i don't believe that anybody
feels the way i do
 about you now
back beat
 the word was on the street
that the fire in your heart is out
i'm sure you've heard it all before
but you never really had a doubt
i don't believe that anybody
feels the way i do about you now
and all the roads we have to walk are winding
and all the lights that lead us there are blinding
there are many things that iwould like to say to you but i don't know how
because maybe
 you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
 you're my wonderwall
today was gonna be the day
but they'll never throw it back to you
by now you should've somehow
realized what you're not to do
i don't believe that anybody
feels the way i do
 about you now
and all the roads that lead you there are winding
and all the lights that light the way are blinding
there are many things that iwould like to say to you but i don't know how
i said maybe
 you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
 you're my wonderwall
i said maybe
 you're gonna be the one that saves me
and after all
 you're my wonderwall
i said maybe
 you're gonna be the one that saves me
you're gonna be the one that saves me

so you call out the feelings you hope that don't never exist
but don't be ashamed of your bones and your blisters
so come on come on my brothers and sisters'cause you can only be what you are
and you've got the heart of a star
but the light never hits ya
and i said come on come on my brothers and sisters
if you could see what i could see maybe we could all get along
and maybe i could justify the bad things in life that i've done
so i call out the feelings i know that don't ever exist
i wont be ashamed of my bones and my blisters
so come on come on my brothers and sisters
'cause you can only be what you are'cause you've got the heart the heart of a star
but the light never hits ya
and i said come on come on my brothers and sisters
and the slower that you go
the greener the grass grows
and what we all need is love in our lives
so go about your business'cause life aint your mistress
come on
 come on my brothers and sisters'cause you can only be what you are'cause you've got the heart of a star
but the light never hits ya
so be all you can
and just hold up your hands
someday you'll understand why life never kissed ya
and i said come on come on my brothers and sisters
come on
 come on my brothers and sisters
i said come on come on my brothers and sisters
here i stand with head in hand
i turn my face to the wall
if she's gone i can't go on
feeling two foot small
everywhere people stare
each and every day
i can hear them laugh at me
and i hear them say
hey you've got to hide your love away!
how can i even try?
'cause i can never win
seeing them hearing them
in the state i'm in
how could she say to me love will find a way?
gather 'round all you clowns
let me hear you say
hey you've got to hide your love away!
